# Feature Breakdown
1. üßë‚Äçüíº User Management
Handles registration, authentication, profile updates, and role differentiation between hosts and guests.
This feature ensures that users can securely access the platform, create accounts, log in, and manage their personal data and preferences

2. üè† Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, and delete rental properties, including details like location, price, photos, and amenities.
It enables the platform to offer diverse accommodation options by giving hosts full control over their listings.

3. üìÖ Booking System
Enables guests to book properties for specific dates, view availability, and manage reservations.
This is the core transactional feature that connects users to listings and processes the rental flow.

4. üí≥ Payment Integration
Supports payment processing for bookings and may include refunds or cancellation policies.
It ensures smooth financial transactions between guests and hosts, making the platform trustworthy and functional.

5. üìù Review & Rating System
Allows guests to rate properties and leave feedback after their stay.
This adds credibility to listings and helps future guests make informed decisions.

6. üîç Search & Filter Functionality
Lets users search for properties by location, price, date, rating, and other filters.
It improves user experience by making it easier to find suitable listings quickly and efficiently.

7. üñºÔ∏è Image Upload & Gallery
Hosts can upload photos for each property, helping guests visualize their stay.
This feature significantly impacts booking decisions and the overall appeal of the listing.

8. üîê Role-Based Access Control
Restricts certain actions to specific roles (e.g., only hosts can add properties, only guests can book).
It maintains security and ensures that users interact with the system within their permitted capabilities.

9. üìä Admin Panel / Analytics (Optional Advanced Feature)
Admins can monitor listings, users, and system activity, and hosts may get insights into their property performance.
This adds an operational layer that supports scaling and managing the platform efficiently.


# API Security
Key Security Measures
Authentication (Who are you?)
Implementation: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login sessions.
Purpose: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.

Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest).
Purpose: Prevents users from performing actions they‚Äôre not permitted to (e.g., a guest trying to edit a listing).

Rate Limiting
Implementation: Limit the number of API requests per IP/user using tools like Redis + middleware.
Purpose: Prevents abuse (e.g., brute-force login attempts) and protects the server from overload.

Input Validation & Sanitization
Implementation: Validate all incoming data (e.g., emails, dates) and sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
Purpose: Protects against malicious data and maintains data integrity.

HTTPS / SSL Encryption
Implementation: Enforce HTTPS for all API traffic.
Purpose: Secures data in transit and protects sensitive information (e.g., passwords, payment info).

Token Expiry & Refresh Mechanism
Implementation: Short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens.
Purpose: Limits the risk window if a token is stolen.

CORS Policy
Implementation: Restrict API access to trusted frontend origins.
Purpose: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests from untrusted domains.

Logging & Monitoring
Implementation: Log all authentication attempts, critical actions, and anomalies.
Purpose: Helps in detecting suspicious behavior and responding to threats.

üîí Why Security Is Crucial by Project Area
Area	Why Security Matters
User Data: To protect personal information (names, emails, etc.) from breaches and identity theft.
Authentication: To prevent unauthorized access to accounts or impersonation.
Payments: To secure financial transactions and prevent fraud or chargebacks.
Property Listings: To avoid malicious users deleting/editing listings they don‚Äôt own.
Bookings: To prevent users from tampering with or canceling others' bookings.
Reviews:	To ensure the integrity of user-generated content and prevent spam or defamation.
